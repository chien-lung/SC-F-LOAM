# SC-F-LOAM
ROB-530-Final-Project

## Prerequisites (dependencies)
- We mainly depend on ROS, Ceres (for A-LOAM), and GTSAM (for pose-graph optimization). 
    - For the details to install the prerequisites, please follow the [A-LOAM](https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/A-LOAM), [LIO-SAM](https://github.com/TixiaoShan/LIO-SAM), and [F-LOAM](https://github.com/wh200720041/floam) repositiory. 
- The below examples are done under ROS melodic (ubuntu 18) and GTSAM version 4.x.

## How to use? 
- First, install the abovementioned dependencies, and follow below lines. 
```
    mkdir -p ~/catkin_scfloam_ws/src
    cd ~/catkin_scfloam_ws/src
    git clone https://github.com/zirui-xu/ROB-530-Final-Project.git
    cd ../
    catkin_make
    source ~/catkin_scfloam_ws/devel/setup.bash
    roslaunch scfloam scfloam_velodyne_HDL_64.launch # Import data after launching it
```

- Output will be saved to `save_directory` in `scfloam_velodyne_HDL_64.launch`. Please modify it to the directory you want. Save utility follows [SC-LIO-SAM's save utility](https://github.com/gisbi-kim/SC-LIO-SAM#applications).
### Some problems you might encounter
- `catkin_make` fail: make it until success (in my case, 3 times) if you install everything well.

## How to import data?
### Raw data way:
Download data from [Kitti website](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_odometry.php) to `YOUR_KITTI_DATASET_DIRECTORY`. 
```
- Download odometry data set (grayscale, 22 GB)
- Download odometry data set (velodyne laser data, 80 GB)
- Download odometry ground truth poses (4 MB)
```

The directory should form like
```
| YOUR_KITTI_DATASET_DIRECTORY 
    |-- results
        |-- 00.txt
        |-- 01.txt
        |-- ...
    |-- sequences 
        |-- 00
            |-- calib.txt
            |-- times.txt
            |-- image_0
                |-- 000000.png
                |-- 000001.png
                |-- ...
            |-- image_1
                |-- 000000.png
                |-- 000001.png
                |-- ...
            |-- velodyne
                |-- 000000.bin
                |-- 000001.bin
                |-- ...
        |-- 01
        |-- ...
```

Modify `kitti_helper.launch` to fit your data (e.g., `dataset_folder`).

```
    source ~/catkin_scfloam_ws/devel/setup.bash
    roslaunch scfloam kitti_helper.launch
```
Note: You can also generate rosbag by running the above command. Just change parameters of `kitti_helper.launch` (i.e., set `to_bag` to `true` and `output_bag_file` to `YOUR_ROSBAG_DIRECTORY`).


### Rosbag way: 
Play the wrapped kitti data in `XXX.bag`. [Here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12rBBkP_X75x5OCh5TycSY4e8K34nVIod?usp=sharing) you can download some preprocessed rosbags.
```
    rosbag play YOUR_ROSBAG_DIRECTORY/XXX.bag
```
Note: you should run `roscore` in the other terminal before running the above command.

The result trajectory generated for Kitti00, Kitti02 and Kitti05 are shown as below, see "How to evaluate?" for evaluation. The dashed line is the ground truth of the map, the blue line is the estimate of F-LOAM, and the red line for SC-F-LOAM.

The following histogram is comparison of A-LOAM, SC-A-LOAM, F-LOAM, and SC-F-LOAM on Kitti00, Kitti02 and Kitti05. ATE and ARE are in absolute value, and ARE is a unitless estimate.

## How to evaluate?
- First, you need to put the output file generated by SC-F-LOAM to certain folders. The `odom_poses.txt`, `optimized_poses.txt`, `times.txt`, `convert.m`, and the ground truth (`00.txt` for Kitti00) should be arranged in the directory like:

```
| YOUR_PROJECT_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY 
    |-- Kitti00
        |-- SC-F-LOAM
            |-- odom_poses.txt
            |-- optimized_poses.txt
            |-- times.txt
        |-- 00.txt
        |-- convert.m
    |-- Kitti01
    |-- ...
```

- After generating corresponding files, you need to open `convert.m` file and change the name of file for 'reading time and sample ground truth accordingly' to 'SC-A-LOAM/times.txt' or 'SC-A-LOAM/times.txt' if you want to estimate SC-A-LOAM or SC-F-LOAM.

- Then run `convert.m` file to generate a `ground_truth.txt` file from the '00/02/05.txt' file of ground truth. This is because:
    - The frames of original ground truth are not the same as output estimates.
    - The x, y and z dimensions of the original ground truth are not the same as output estimates.

- Finally, you can install “evo”, an evaluation tool, from https://github.com/MichaelGrupp/evo or by ```pip install evo``` or other methods you prefer. Then you can use evo for evaluation according to its instructions. Some sample commands for evaluation are shown as below:

    - If you want to compare trajectories against ground truth, you can use the following command:
    ```
    evo_traj kitti SC-F-LOAM\odom_poses.txt SC-F-LOAM\optimized_poses.txt --ref=ground_truth.txt -p --plot_mode=yx
    ```

    - If you want to estimate error, use

    ```
    evo_ape kitti ground_truth.txt SC-F-LOAM\odom_poses.txt -va --plot --plot_mode yx --save_results SC-F-LOAM/odom_poses.zip
    ```

    - To make detailed comparison use

    ```
    evo_res SC-F-LOAM\odom_poses.zip SC-F-LOAM\optimized_poses.zip -p --save_table SC-F-LOAM/comparison.csv
    ```
